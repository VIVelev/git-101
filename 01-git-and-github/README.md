# What are git and GitHub?

## What is git?
A distributed version control system (VCS). Not the only one, but undoubtedly the most popular. <br>
Created by Linus Torvalds to aid the development of Linux.

### Two important features:
 - version control - managing versions of files automatically
 - collaboration

## What is GitHub?
A web service, similar to Google Drive, but specialized for software. You can think of it as "a social network for developers where git projects live". <br>
GitHub is **NOT** git, although GitHub runs git under-the-hood.
