# Doesn't the multiplication cheat sheet look, wrong?
Indeed, 32 x 45 is not 1240, it is 1440. <br>
Lets fix that.

## First, make the changes:
```
1 x 2 = 2
2 x 2 = 4
32 x 45 = 1440
```

## Stage the changes:
```bash
$ git add .
```

## Make the commit:
```bash
$ git commit -m "[Fix] 32 x 45 is not 1240, it is 1440"
```

## Greate job!
Now you know how a typical git cycle works.
- Make changes
- Stage changes
- Make commit
