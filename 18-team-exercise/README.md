# git & GitHub team exercise

Now that you are familiar with git & GitHub, lets test your knowledge by creating
a mini project with your team.

We would ask you to make simple HTML + CSS pages.

Note: If you are not familiar with HTML and CSS, check this out: https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp

## Step 1:

Create a new repository and add your teammates as collaborators.

## Step 2:

Make a simple HTML page (`index.html`) in the **master** branch. <br>
Collaborate with your team to make a header with your team name and add some description of the team
as a paragraph.

## Step 3:

Now, every team member should make him/herself a branch with the name **name_branch** where name is the team member's name. <br>
In their branch, the members should create a HTML page `About` (`about.html`) in which they upload a photo and write some text about them, their favorite food or whatever they like. :) <br>

## Step 4:

Sit together as a team, and merge the branches, so at the end you get a single `About` page where every team member's picture and text are visible on the master branch.
You can use `git blame <file>` to *blame* each other for bugs you've made. ;)

## Step 5:

After you are happy with the state of your repo, ***submit here: https://forms.gle/S4ctzTTpMyS8kV7AA*** <br>
You can submit more than once, the latest submission will be taken when grading.

# What about prizes?

Prizes? Ofcourse there are prizes. The team with the best repository/website will recieve a special git prize during Hack TUES 6. :)

But to have a chance in winning the prize ***you should submit your repository by 06.03 23:59:59 EET***.

## Example

Check out `index.html` and `about.html` for an example of what you should aim to achieve.
